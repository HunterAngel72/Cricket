# Cricket ðŸ¦—

![Main Icon](assets/mainIcon.png)

Cricket is a lightweight and practical CAM application designed to work with PCB files. It currently allows you to generate board outlines, cut cards, and drill holes in PCBs, offering a simple workflow for basic manufacturing tasks.

The project is in constant evolution. Upcoming goals include:
- An integrated Gerber and DRL file editor.
- Advanced visualization tools, such as grids and different view modes.
- A complete undo/redo system for safer and more flexible work.

The idea behind Cricket is to grow as long as it remains useful and practical for the community. In the short term, several additional versions will focus on bug fixes and the addition of the undo/redo system, while exploring new features that make PCB work easier.
